            The band gained fame thanks to the album "Youth in punk style" and the first two singles "lbtd" and "shut up". In almost two years of its existence, a total of 10 video clips were shot. The clip "keep quiet" gained viral popularity, due to which the collective for the first year of its existence performed on "Invasion" and appeared in the program "Evening Urgant".

        I didn't think to get into it like that, it happens, so what?<br>
I can't believe that something will captivate me in it <br>
We're with you, and I'm listening to his vinyl outside the door <br>
If I got a teacher, bitch, even if he was a doctor <br>
That wouldn't be such a bummer <br>
How could I be so confused <br>
Meeting your father <br>
Only one of his facial features <br>
In the head are drawn <br>
Stop calling me endlessly <br>
Send messages to Whatsapp <br>
Everyone should figure it out for himself <br>
It's better we don't see each other <br>
How could I be so confused <br>
Meeting your father <br>
Only one of his facial features <br>
In the head are drawn <br>
Stop calling me endlessly <br>
Send messages to Whatsapp <br>
Everyone should figure it out for <br>

        Save and save <br>
They say I need to carry people like you in my arms <br>
You're as beautiful as July <br>
And there's nothing to complain about, but what do I give a fuck <br>
Then why is it so lazy to go to the cinema with you again? <br>
Why did I go out drinking wine with my friends again? <br>
You're the best habit, it's hard to forget you, <br>
Sorry, I don't want to smoke <br>
How could I be so confused <br>
Meeting your father <br>
Only one of his facial features <br>
In the head are drawn <br>
Stop calling me endlessly <br>
Send messages to Whatsapp <br>
Everyone should figure it out for himself <br>
It's better we don't see each other <br>
How so? Why?<br>
They say there is a place for all kinds of shit in life <br>
Never and for nothing <br>
